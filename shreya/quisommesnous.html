		<h2 class="partie1">Group creation and name's origin</h2>
		<p class="content">Putting the group together was quite simple as we got to know each other
		during the first semester. We knew each other’s strengths and weaknesses,<br/>
and keeping all these factors in mind, we chose each other as teammates on
this project. Also, the fact that we know each other and have developed an
affinity for each other was also an advantage <br/>for us, as it would guarantee a
good understanding and cohesion of the group.
Our name, ”4-sight”, refers to the ability to predict what will happen or be
needed in the future. This name has an important meaning for us because we
aspire to acquire this ability.
We are four people with a common passion: computers. This video game
is a way for us to apply everything we have been taught so far while learning
new things. Each member of this group is essential.<br/> Each one has a field in
which he is really gifted, some will be better in programming, others have more
creativity, it is this diversity which makes the richness of this group.</p>
